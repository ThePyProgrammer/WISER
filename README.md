## Code Outline
```
Line 1 imports all functions from the module turtle.
Lines 3 to 5 set up the screen (e.g. background colour, screen size, title of window).
Lines 6 and 7 set the speed and pensize of the turtle.
Lines 8 to 17 set the list of colors that will be used later.
Lines 19 to 33 draw the background image.
Lines 35 to 46 draw the pathway-like structure and write out the text.
```

## Relevance
The image shows a pathway slanted a bit to symbolise that it is off track. This shows that this is unlike most of our usual life and hence shows a curiosity - Wonderment.

Also, the path follows a similar concept to redshift, and hence shows astronomy, which involves looking into space, a region we are still unfamiliar with after millennia even. We need the wonderment for even going into an industry that would take decades worth of research but could ultimately be for nothing - Wonderment.

Many associate red with a hot region and blue with a cool region. Hence, we can state that as the redshift-type pathway continues, the pathway keeps getting hotter and hotter, which is a real challenge. Through this challenge we should persevere - Resilience.

In traffic signals, Red signifies ‘don’t move’ and Green signifies ‘move’. This shows how easy it is to get in by green, you are going along with the orders… along with the wind. However, when your reach red, you have to move against the wind, a real challenge. Similar to the above challenge, through this challenge we should persevere - Resilience.

We can look at the way a bit more differently. In the Marvel Studios movie “Thor”, there is a particular bridge known as the ‘Bifrost Bridge’, which is applies the Einstein-Rosen Bridge Wormhole Theorem. This bridge is very colored and can teleport any person from its world, Asgard, to any other planet. For example, Earth, Jotunheim etc. This tunnel I have made can also be treated as a pathway to a new world… a new opportunity… a new horizon. It is very much out of curiosity - Wonderment.

At the very end of the spectrum, at the end of the red, shows a rainbow… something people are very much mesmerised by - Wonderment.

This shows how excelling always bears sweet fruit - Excellence.
